## Overview
This app gives your age in years, months and days. Just put your date of birth and you will get your age in result. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### What I learned

In this dev challenge you learn alot about **Date functions in javascript**. Because there are many limitations and much understanding required about input formats and output values of Date function. So, lets cover most of the useful senerioes of this method with me. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN documentation]([https://www.example.com](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date)) - This helped me for learning the Date object thoroughly. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
